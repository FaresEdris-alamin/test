### 1.task no.1 [counter]
  Make a counter game. The counter goes up by 1 everytime yoou click a button (can just be any button click on the terminal too doesn't have to be in html)
  but every time you click the button there's a chance that the counter resets to 0. 
  That chance starts at 0% and goes up by 1% each time you click the button.
